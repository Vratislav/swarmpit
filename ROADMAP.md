# Overview

Swarmpit is aimed to support Docker Swarm Mode and its abstraction. Therefore we won't be supporting  the majority of container API or any different orchestration platform. 
 
## What we did so far 
 
### 1.0 Release

The first official release was focusing mainly on usability and coverage of docker service API.

We introduced distribution API so users can easily browse across their Dockerhub accounts and
custom Docker registries. On the top of that, sharing these accounts with other Swarmpit users
can be done by simple publishing.

Deployment section offers auto-redeploy, which checks whether new version of service image has been
published and update the service automatically.

Swarmpit is trying to help users as much as possible so we prefetch placement filters based
on cluster settings and resource plugins as well.

Also, exposable ports were introduced.

### 1.1 Release

Service logs viewer was added in this version. Also service rollback and redeploy button has been introduced.

-  [[#20](https://github.com/swarmpit/swarmpit/issues/20)] Add service logging
-  [[#99](https://github.com/swarmpit/swarmpit/issues/99)] Allow to set services log-driver
-  [[#111](https://github.com/swarmpit/swarmpit/issues/111)] Add service rollback button
-  [[#101](https://github.com/swarmpit/swarmpit/issues/101)] Add service redeploy button

### 1.2 Release

This release was mainly aimed for swarmpit stabilization. We fixed couple of issues related to docker client
and stack inconsistency. Also all backend clients were switched from httpkit to clj-http mainly because SSL
termination issues. On top of that we introduced suggestable env variables, service resource management and
humanized time on FE.

- [[#134](https://github.com/swarmpit/swarmpit/issues/134)] Add service resource management
- [[#90](https://github.com/swarmpit/swarmpit/issues/90)] Suggest environment variables
- [[#138](https://github.com/swarmpit/swarmpit/issues/138)] Replace httpkit on server by clj-http
- [[#139](https://github.com/swarmpit/swarmpit/issues/139)] Show local times in FE
